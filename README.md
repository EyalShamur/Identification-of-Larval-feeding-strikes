Eyal Shamur, Tal Hassner, Miri Zilka, Victor China, Alex Liberzon, Roi Holzman, "Identification of feeding strikes by larval fish from continuous high-speed digital video":  The paper provides a framework for automated detection of prey acquisition strikes from a long video of foraging larvae, a behavior that is infrequent yet critical for larval survival. Supervised learning models of local volume video descriptors are used to generate the detection by classification framework.  We compared the performance of the proposed framework against manually identified feeding events. Our results indicate that the effort required by an expert to manually label videos can be reduced from weeks to hours, enabling the assembly of large, unbiased dataset of ecologically relevant behaviors.
